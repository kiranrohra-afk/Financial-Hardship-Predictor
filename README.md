# Financial Hardship Predictor

- This project investigates Canadaâ€™s productivity pay gap through data cleaning, visualization, and linear regression
modeling using Pandas.
- The ratio between the median income and GDP was analyzed to discover whether or not median income has risen
with productivity. A decade analysis was also conducted, and found that median income by decade remained the
same, while GDP increased drastically
